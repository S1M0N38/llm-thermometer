## About LLM Thermometer

LLM Thermometer estimates temperature values of Large Language Models through semantic similarity analysis. It analyzes how diverse the responses are for the same prompt to infer the temperature setting used during generation.

### Approach

1. **Generation**: Produce multiple responses using the same prompt
2. **Similarity Analysis**: Measure semantic similarity between responses
3. **Temperature Estimation**: Infer temperature based on response diversity
   - Higher temperature ‚Üí More diverse responses (lower similarity)
   - Lower temperature ‚Üí More consistent responses (higher similarity)
